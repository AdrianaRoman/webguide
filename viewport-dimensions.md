### Responsive Web Design

**The Web Standards Group recommends** that campus websites do not target
a specific screen resolution in their designs. Instead, campus websites should
employ responsive web design (RWD) to support a range of resolutions and
devices.

Within RWD, media queries, a flexible grid,
and flexible media (including images and video) are combined
to create website designs that transform depending on the capabilities of the
user's browser, most prominently the browser's width.

### Printable Alternatives

Make sure that your page content prints appropriately. Test by printing and,
if necessary, provide a printable alternative.
