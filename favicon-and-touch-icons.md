A "favicon" will generally appear near a browser's address bar when a user
is visiting your website.

However, these icons can appear in a number of places beyond the address
bar, including alongside the website's name on a browser tab and
on the "home screens" of mobile devices. As a result, the favicon should
provide a simple and straightforward visual cue to help a user quickly
identify your website amongst other websites.

At the very least, **the Web Standards Group recommends** creating a
`favicon.ico` file and placing it in the *root* directory of your website
(this particular icon does *not* need to be specified with a `meta` tag
in the HTML).

This `favicon.ico` file should contain *two* images of different sizes:
16x16 and 32x32.

This provides a **bare level** of support for browsers and devices.

To create a better user experience across a number of platforms, including
varying pixel densities, devices, and operating systems, refer to the
[open-source favicon cheat sheet](https://github.com/audreyr/favicon-cheat-sheet).
