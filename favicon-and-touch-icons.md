`favicon.ico` will generally be displayed near the address bar of a browser.
Touch icons will be displayed when the website visitor puts a bookmark linking
to the website on their mobile device's home screen. These images do not need
to be specified in the HTML; they will automatically be requested by the browser.

To target all devices, create and provide the following icons in the root of
your website:

* `apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png`
* `apple-touch-icon-114x114-precomposed.png`
* `apple-touch-icon-72x72-precomposed.png`
* `apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png`
* `apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png`
* `favicon.ico`
