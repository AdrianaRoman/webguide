### Importance of Web Accessibility

"Accessibility is a Civil Rights issue and inaccessible websites violate the
*effective communications* requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) as well as provisions of Section 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.
Just as the rights of disabled people are ensured by providing closed
captioning for television programs, auditory crosswalk indicators or elevators
and ramps in buildings with stairs, so too is it our obligation and
responsibility to similarly accommodate the needs of the disabled when it comes
to accessing electronic systems and data."
(Source: [UCSB Web Accessibility Guidelines (PDF)](/media/web-accessibility-guidelines.pdf))

All campus units should make every effort to comply with WSG accessibility
recommendations.

An accessible website means that people with disabilities are able to obtain
the same information in an adaptable format that is available to persons who do
not have a disability and who are not using adaptive technology. Your web page
also needs to take reasonable measures to ensure you are not causing undue harm
to persons with disabilities. A summary of key accessibility resources with
respect to web pages is presented below.

If you have any questions regarding your responsibility for designing or
maintaining an accessible web page or if you feel that you are unable to access
a web page on campus because it lacks the required accessible features, please
contact one of the individuals listed under our campus resources.

### UCOP IT Accessibility Policies

In 2013, the
[UC Electronic Accessibility Leadership Team (EALT)](http://www.ucop.edu/electronic-accessibility/initiative/leadership-team.html)
proposed a
[new systemwide accessibility policy](http://www.ucop.edu/electronic-accessibility/initiative/proposed-policy.html),
which included the requirement that all websites should meet the
[WCAG 2.0 Level AA Success](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) requirements.

For a guide on how to meet these requirements, use the
[customizable quick reference](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).
