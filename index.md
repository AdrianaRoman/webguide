### Mission Statement

The mission of this site is to help campus website developers create policy
compliant websites that utilize industry best practices and policies set forth
by the federal government and the University of California. This guide should
provide a useful reference to website development on campus.

### About

The standards described on this site have been developed and endorsed by the
**UCSB Web Standards and Content Working Group (WSG)**, a task force made up of
web professionals from across the UCSB campus.

When initially introduced in 2006, the WSG recognized that many UCSB websites
had been developed before the standards were proposed and that it would be
impractical to apply the standards to existing websites. The recommendation
at that time was to apply these standards to newly developed websites.

With this latest revision of the webguide, the WSG strongly encourages website
developers to bring existing sites up to policy and accessibility compliance.
