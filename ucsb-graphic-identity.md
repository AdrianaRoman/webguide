Historically speaking this webguide provided recommendations on graphics identity for UCSB affiliated websites. In November 2015 the department of Public Affairs and Communications released a toolkit regarding UCSB Graphics Identity. This new material which is itself a living document effectively replaces any prior recommendations the Web Standards Group put forth regarding websites developed for/by the campus.

The toolkit provided by Public Affairs and Communications may be found at the [UC Santa Barbara Graphics Identity Website](http://www.ucsb.edu/graphic-identity/).
