### UCSB WSG Webguide

This is the UCSB Web Standards Group webguide which is a static website whose content provides recommendations and best practices for websites hosted within and affiliated with www.ucsb.edu. These recommendations are intended to be broad enough to apply to most any website in any domain -- but an emphasis is placed on Higher Ed web content.

This site has been moved to Github and Jekyll with the goal of increasing social collaboration on the webguide.
