Providing contact information on websites is convenient and allows your
audience the ability to communicate with your department. But websites also
provide spammers a source of e-mail addresses to target. Your department's
needs should be evaluated against the pros and cons of the various solutions.

### Avoid Displaying Personal Email Addresses

Do not display personal e-mail addresses (e.g., "joe.gaucho@ucsb.edu") on web
pages. Instead, use **contact forms** that allow the user to send an e-mail by
submitting a form or an **e-mail alias** that forwards to another account.

### Contact Forms and Aliases

A contact form or e-mail alias provides a number of benefits, including:

* Protecting an individual department member's email address from being vulnerable to spam or other unwanted email
* Routing general enquiries to a specific person or multiple people within the department
* Keeping a web site updated. For example, if John Smith leaves his position, the contact form or email alias can be directed to the next person who fills his position</li>
