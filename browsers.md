**The Web Standards Group recommends** that webpages be designed to work with
the browsers that approximately 90% of your website's visitors use. Please
note that the usage statistics for your website may vary from the statistics
cited here. Website maintainers may want to consider using web analytics tools
to analyze traffic statistics for their site. Website managers should make
sure that any chosen analytics tool complies with UC and UCSB policies
(Google Analytics' third party indemnification clause does not comply as of
2013).

### Vendor Requirements

The standards described on this page may be used for vendor requirements.
For example:
*"Product must work with approximately 90% of our current usage."*
