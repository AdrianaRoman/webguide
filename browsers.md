**The Web Standards Group recommends** that webpages be designed to work with
the browsers and platforms that **approximately 90% of your website's visitors use**.

### Analytics

Website maintainers should **use web analytics tools** to analyze traffic
statistics for their site.

As of June 2015, UCSB policy allows the use of **Google Analytics** for tracking
website visitor statistics. But, departments and entities using Google
Analytics should abide by the [procedures (PDF)](http://www.policy.ucsb.edu/policies/advisory-docs/clickthrough-guide.pdf)
outlined by the announcement of campus support of Google Analytics and other
click-through agreements.

While Google Analytics may be used on campus websites, UCSB Enterprise
Technology Services offers the [Piwik Analytics Platform](http://www.ets.ucsb.edu/services/ets-web-analytics)
as a service to campus entities as a centrally hosted, on-campus alternative to
a third-party vendor service.

### Vendor Requirements

The standards described on this page may be used for vendor requirements.
For example:

*"Product must work with approximately 90% of our current usage."*
