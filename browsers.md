**The Web Standards Group recommends** that webpages be designed to work with
the browsers that approximately 90% of your website's visitors use. Please
note that the usage statistics for your website may vary from the statistics
cited here. Website maintainers may want to consider using web analytics tools
to analyze traffic statistics for their site.

As of June 2015 UCSB policy allows the use of Google Analytics for tracking website visitor statistics. But, departments and entities [using Google Analytics should abide by the procedures outlined by the announcement of campus support of Google Analytics and other click-thru agreements](http://www.policy.ucsb.edu/policies/advisory-docs/clickthrough-guide.pdf).

While Google Analytics may be used on campus websites, the [UCSB Enterprise Technology Services offers the Piwik Analytics Platform as a service to campus entities](http://www.ets.ucsb.edu/services/ets-web-analytics) as a centrally hosted, on-campus alternative to a 3rd party vendor service.

### Vendor Requirements

The standards described on this page may be used for vendor requirements.
For example:
*"Product must work with approximately 90% of our current usage."*
