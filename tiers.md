The Web Standards Group has grouped UCSB websites into three tiers, based on
various factors: association with the University identity, sphere of influence,
frequency and volume of use, expected lifetime, and other factors. A website's
position reflects how strongly we believe that site should adhere to the
standards defined in this guide. *All campus units, regardless of the tier,
should make every effort to comply with WSG accessibility recommendations.*
The tiers are described below, followed by examples of selected sites in each
tier. Other sites will be added in the future.
